# Simple React app using the Star Wars API and Semantic UI React

This app is based on The Net Ninja's tutorial on [React Query](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jpi7Ptjl5b50p9gLjOFani), **with few additions**:

- The whole UI is implemented using [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/)
- Slight improvement in pagination using the Semantic UI React `Pagination` component.
- Formating of planet population in millions.
- Use of `localStorage` to remember the last menu and page number visited upon app reload.

The app is deployed to Netlify [here](https://serene-wescoff-121912.netlify.app/).
